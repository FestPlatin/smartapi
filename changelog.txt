------------------------------------
Major API overhaul in preparation of the 1.0 long term API stable release.

  to make automatic testing of client code easier,
  because Smart API can now be mocked and no real RedDot server is needed.

  future extension without breaking source/binary compatibility or cluttering of
  interfaces/namespaces

- Page elements referencing files in subfolders no longer throw an exception on access to the file
- Creating a Session object for an existing session on server versions before 10.0 no longer creates a new session key, 
  if the project isn't switched
